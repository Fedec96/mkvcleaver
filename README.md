# MKVCleaver

MKVCleaver is a front end for MKVExtract.exe which extracts data from MKV files.

This is only a GitHub mirror for Ilia Bakhmoutski's MKVCleaver source code, that can be found [here](https://blogs.sapib.ca/apps/mkvcleaver/). I am *not* the author of MKVCleaver.

Currently version 0.8.0.0, Windows-64 bit.
